Objective: Make a spec sheet to translate concept and goals to user and developer.
Team: Jorge, Gunner, and Brittney

Work: I(Jorge) assisted Gunner in developing a spec sheet for the project. Later Brittany arrived and provided input. We also started on developing the classes for the project
and divided the work evenly amongst us three. This weekend I am working on the classes in room.py. Gunner is working on either the event manager or the file manager.

We are discussing and planning the material for the event.py file. We discussed the validator file and different approaches to modularizing the functions into the code for cohesion with other files. I was assigned the validator.py file. I am thinking about using try catch methods on the input that the user inputs into the program.
I was assigned to work on all events by room sorted by date.
